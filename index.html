                <h3>I love building tools that are <span class="deve">user-friendly, simple</span> and delightful.<br>
                    I was a student in Lambda School where I spent 8 months the fundamentals of front-end and back-end
                    web development.
                    I also worked at Lambda where my role was split between helping scale processes through automations
                    and overseeing student teams.<br>

                    Through this experience, I had the opportunity to work with both small and large, specialised and
                    cross-functional teams across different time zones and developed a working style that leans towards
                    flexibility, clarity, and collaboration.
                    I'm currently looking for anew role as a developer. Hire me?
